# MiVetTask

MiVet is a Startup whose goal is to streamline equine veterinary care through modern technology on their platform.
MiVet is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET and REACT code for the Video Chat and the Subscription Level of a Vet in the Vet Dashboard and entices them to upgrade their subscription tier feature.
